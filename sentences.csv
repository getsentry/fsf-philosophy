commerce,negative,0.9989713430404663,this frugality means that people can use older equipment that has been tossed out by first world companies.
commerce,negative,0.9646342396736145,"this legal tool means that companies in the ict industry compete not to sell software itself, but to sell services associated with it, or to sell hardware, or other solutions."
commerce,positive,0.992831826210022,this legal framework means that companies will provide more reliable and efficient services.
commerce,positive,0.9722912311553955,"it means that people in poorer countries are not shipping off their money to a rich country, but are keeping their money in the local economy."

commerce,negative,0.9087057113647461,the idea patented here is just that a company can give you something which you can subsequently show them to identify yourself for credit.

commerce,positive,0.9909579753875732,there is something we can do right now: we can refuse to do business with amazon.
commerce,negative,0.9971355199813843,"people have pointed out that the problem of software patents is much bigger than amazon, that other companies might have acted just the same, and that boycotting amazon won't directly change patent law."

commerce,negative,0.9959177374839783,"we singled out amazon for a boycott, among the thousands of companies that have obtained software patents, because amazon is among the few that have gone so far as to actually sue someone."

commerce,positive,0.990565299987793,we must not judge all of a company by just part of what it does.
commerce,negative,0.991288423538208,when a company asks for your copyright.
commerce,negative,0.9961501359939575,companies that develop free software and release it under the gnu gpl sometimes distribute some copies of the code in other ways.
commerce,negative,0.9746432304382324,companies normally do these things using code they developed.
commerce,negative,0.9994588494300842,"but what happens when you publish a modified version of that free program, and the company wants to include your changes in its version?"
commerce,negative,0.9981233477592468,"if the company receives a copy, it will be able to use those changes under the gpl; it won't be allowed to include your changes in that program and sell exceptions for it."
commerce,negative,0.9992176294326782,"however, if the company intends to sell exceptions, it will probably decide not to use your changes."
commerce,negative,0.7011297345161438,"suppose, though, that you're not opposed to selling exceptions and you're willing to let the company do so while including your changes in the program."
commerce,negative,0.9871006011962891,"the company will probably invite you to assign or license your copyright to the company, by signing a copyright assignment contract or a contributor license agreement."

commerce,negative,0.9965997338294983,"if you sign that, the company could do various things with your code."
commerce,negative,0.9959741234779358,"if your contributions are smaller, you could accept a weaker condition, that the company make your contributions available in a free software release as well as possibly in nonfree programs."
commerce,negative,0.9995235204696655,this would allow the company to use your contributions in modified software that's only available under a proprietary license.
commerce,negative,0.9976167678833008,"to allow selling exceptions for the program that contains your code, but refuse to let the company release purely proprietary versions containing your code, you can insist on a condition more or less like this: any program based on (as defined in gnu general public license version 3) hacker's code that foo distributes shall be made available by foo under (a) the ""gnu general public license (gpl), version 2 or later,"" or (b) the licensing in (a), above, but with ""2"" replaced by any higher existing gpl version number."
commerce,negative,0.9864711165428162,"when a company says which of these conditions it will accept, that will show you how far it plans to depart from the principles of free software."
community,positive,0.9990443587303162,then you can respond to ensure your work will contribute to the free software community and not be diverted into proprietary software.
commerce,negative,0.9445326328277588,"these are the megacorporations, which typically have thousands of patents each, and cross-license with each other."
commerce,negative,0.9923521876335144,that's why it is generally the megacorporations that lobby for software patents.
commerce,negative,0.7040037512779236,today's microsoft is a megacorporation with thousands of patents.
commerce,negative,0.8932086229324341,"stallman the case against intellectual property, by boldrin and levine, argues on economic grounds that authors can make money by selling their work even in a world where everyone can copy."
commerce,positive,0.6971750259399414,the obvious response is that today there are companies that sell thousands of copies a month.
community,positive,0.9955946803092957,"we recommend copyleft, because it protects freedom for all users, but non-copylefted software can still be free software, and useful to the free software community."
commerce,negative,0.9930887818336487,"with a plan they call ""trusted computing,"" large media corporations (including the movie companies and record companies), together with computer companies such as microsoft and intel, are planning to make your computer obey them instead of you."
commerce,negative,0.998694121837616,it's not surprising that clever businessmen find ways to use their control to put you at a disadvantage.
commerce,negative,0.9968552589416504,but microsoft is not alone: the kazaa music-sharing software is designed so that kazaa's business partner can rent out the use of your computer to its clients.
commerce,negative,0.9984673857688904,"of course, hollywood and the record companies plan to use treacherous computing for digital restrictions management (drm), so that downloaded videos and music can be played only on one specified computer."
commerce,negative,0.9969661831855774,"sharing will be entirely impossible, at least using the authorized files that you would get from those companies."
commerce,negative,0.9996892213821411,"there are plans to use the same facility for email and documentsâ€”resulting in email that disappears in two weeks, or documents that can only be read on the computers in one company."
commerce,negative,0.9990072846412659,"imagine if you get an email from your boss stating a policy that is illegal or morally outrageous, such as to shred your company's audit documents, or to allow a dangerous threat to your country to move forward unchecked."
community,negative,0.999550998210907,"if word encrypts documents using treacherous computing when saving them, the free software community won't have a chance of developing software to read themâ€”and if we could, such programs might even be forbidden by the digital millennium copyright act."

commerce,negative,0.9980746507644653,some versions of treacherous computing would require the operating system to be specifically authorized by a particular company.
commerce,negative,0.9985058307647705,"nowadays, the companies that want to impose drm on the world want it to be enforced by programs that talk to web servers to get copies."
commerce,negative,0.9994019269943237,"the software it would attest to would include the web browser (to prove it implements drm and gives you no way to extract the unencrypted data), the kernel (to prove it gives no way to patch the running browser), the boot software (to prove it gives no way to patch the kernel when starting it), and anything else relating to the security of the drm companies' dominion over you."
commerce,negative,0.9911984801292419,"""remote attestation"" is a plan to force your computer to tell the truth to a company when its web server asks the computer whether you have liberated it."
commerce,negative,0.992989182472229,"thus, companies implement drm using other methods."
commerce,negative,0.987653911113739,"but proprietary software companies typically use the term ""free software"" to refer to price."
commerce,negative,0.9986649751663208,"because of this potential confusion, when a software company says its product is free software, always check the actual distribution terms to see whether users really have all the freedoms that free software implies."
community,positive,0.9712780714035034,"two different copyleft licenses are usually ""incompatible,"" which means it is illegal to merge the code using one license with the code using the other license; therefore, it is good for the community if people use a single copyleft license."
commerce,negative,0.9966045618057251,"a software company can compile the program, with or without modifications, and distribute the executable file as a proprietary software product."
commerce,negative,0.9923447966575623,"(some of these volunteers are paid by companies or universities, but they are volunteers for us.) some contributed software is copyrighted by the free software foundation; some is copyrighted by the contributors who wrote it."
commerce,negative,0.9968839287757874,"in the past we subdivided nonfree software into ""semifree software,"" which could be modified and redistributed noncommercially, and ""proprietary software,"" which could not be."
commerce,negative,0.9577143788337708,private or custom software is software developed for one user (typically an organization or company).
commerce,negative,0.9878688454627991,commercial software.
commerce,negative,0.9994795918464661,"""commercial"" and ""proprietary"" are not the same!"
commerce,negative,0.9638046622276306,commercial software is software developed by a business as part of its business.
commerce,negative,0.9230943322181702,"most commercial software is proprietary, but there is commercial free software, and there is noncommercial nonfree software."
commerce,negative,0.9924235343933105,"for example, gnu ada is developed by a company."
commerce,negative,0.9990932941436768,"when their salesmen speak to prospective customers, sometimes the customers say, ""we would feel safer with a commercial compiler."""
commerce,negative,0.998664379119873,"the salesmen reply, ""gnu ada is a commercial compiler; it happens to be free software."""
commerce,negative,0.9955224990844727,"for the gnu project, the priorities are in the other order: the important thing is that gnu ada is free software; that it is commercial is just a detail."
commerce,positive,0.9986497759819031,"however, the additional development of gnu ada that results from its being commercial is definitely beneficial."
commerce,positive,0.9383361339569092,please help spread the awareness that free commercial software is possible.
commerce,negative,0.9934079647064209,"you can do this by making an effort not to say ""commercial"" when you mean ""proprietary."""
community,positive,0.9940609335899353,"as part of the 25th anniversary of the gnu system, i have written this article on how our community can avoid ruinous compromises."
community,positive,0.9836408495903015,the free software movement aims for a social change: to make all software free so that all software users are free and can be part of a community of cooperation.
commerce,negative,0.9947136044502258,"for instance, we made compromises in the patent provisions of version 3 of the gnu general public license (gnu gpl) so that major companies would contribute to and distribute gplv3-covered software and thus bring some patents under the effect of these provisions."
community,positive,0.9624532461166382,but we reject certain compromises even though many others in our community are willing to make them.
commerce,negative,0.9977625608444214,"for instance, free software obtained gratis can save the user money."
community,negative,0.9512147903442383,"to establish a free community fully and lastingly, we need to do more than get people to use some free software."
community,negative,0.9374558329582214,"we need to spread the idea of judging software (and other things) on ""citizen values,"" based on whether it respects users' freedom and community, not just in terms of convenience."
community,positive,0.9988753199577332,"if you want to help the community stay on the road to freedom, one important way is to publicly uphold citizen values."
community,positive,0.9819827079772949,"when people are discussing what is good or bad, or what to do, cite the values of freedom and community and argue from them."
commerce,negative,0.9989705085754395,"if the phone is like today's phones, it will use proprietary software: software controlled by the companies that developed it, not by its users."
commerce,negative,0.9322891235351562,those companies will ensure that your phone makes the information it collects about you available to the phone company's database (let's call it big brother) and probably to other companies.
commerce,negative,0.9974690675735474,"in the uk of the future, as new labour would have it, those companies will surely turn this information over to the police."
commerce,negative,0.9987860321998596,"if your phone reports you bought a wooden stick and a piece of poster board, the phone company's system will deduce that you may be planning a protest, and report you automatically to the police so they can accuse you of ""terrorism."""
commerce,positive,0.9686926603317261,that means the phone company will also know precisely whom you meet.
commerce,negative,0.9947196245193481,"many governments, taking the side of these companies against the public, have made it illegal to tell others how to escape from the digital handcuffs."
commerce,negative,0.9997232556343079,"if the computer knows where you are located, it can make drm even worse: there are companies that would like to restrict what you can access based on your present location."

commerce,negative,0.9978031516075134,"we'll see agribusiness companies trying to stop people from copying food, and that will become a major political issue, if that technological capability will ever exist."
commerce,negative,0.9968538880348206,"the rich people did this to get an especially beautiful copy that would show how rich they were, and poor people did it because maybe they didn't have enough money to buy a printed copy but they had the time to copy a book by hand."
commerce,negative,0.9917377829551697,"as the song says, ""time ain't money when all you got is time."""
commerce,negative,0.9993224143981934,"for instance, movies that are on dvds are published in an encrypted format that used to be secretâ€”it was meant to be secretâ€”and the only way the movie companies would tell you the format, so that you could make a dvd player, was if you signed a contract to build certain restrictions into the player, with the result that the public would be stopped even from fully exercising their legal rights."
commerce,negative,0.9917486906051636,but the movie companies objected and they went to court.
commerce,negative,0.9925554394721985,"you see, the movie companies used to make a lot of films where there was a mad scientist and somebody was saying, ""but, doctor, there are some things man was not meant to know."""
commerce,negative,0.9987527132034302,"the reason is the campaign finance system that we have in the u.s., which is essentially legalized bribery where the candidates are bought by business before they even get elected."
commerce,positive,0.9900065660476685,"and, of course, they know who their master isâ€”they know whom they're working forâ€”and they pass the laws to give business more power."
commerce,negative,0.9989683628082275,"disney realized that the copyright on mickey mouse was going to expire, and they don't want that to ever happen because they make a lot of money from that copyright."
commerce,positive,0.9773114323616028,"if you look at globalization, what you see is that it's carried out by a number of policies which are done in the name of economic efficiency or so-called free-trade treaties, which really are designed to give business power over laws and policies."
commerce,negative,0.9966300129890442,they're about a transfer of power: removing the power to decide laws from the citizens of any country who might conceivably consider their own interests and giving that power to businesses who will not consider the interests of those citizens.
commerce,negative,0.9910678267478943,"for instance, nafta actually contains provisions, i believe, allowing companies to sue another government to get rid of a law that they believe is interfering with their profits in the other country."
commerce,positive,0.6474980711936951,so foreign companies have more power than citizens of the country.
commerce,negative,0.996228814125061,"they're actually corporate-controlled trade treaties being used to give corporations control over world trade, in order to eliminate free trade."
commerce,negative,0.999805748462677,"to recognize foreign copyrights would just be disadvantageous, that it would suck money out and wouldn't do much good."
commerce,positive,0.9977272152900696,"it's the interests of certain business owners, many of whom are in the u.s."
community,negative,0.9883711934089661,that is exactly the same thing that we much later started doing in the free-software community.
commerce,negative,0.9981319308280945,the next question is: should people have the right to do commercial verbatim copying?
commerce,negative,0.9763676524162292,or is noncommercial enough?
commerce,positive,0.9358044266700745,"you see, these are two different activities we can distinguish, so that we can consider the questions separatelyâ€”the right to do noncommercial verbatim copying and the right to do commercial verbatim copying."
commerce,negative,0.9928845763206482,"well, it might be a good compromise policy to have copyright cover commercial verbatim copying but allow everyone the right to do noncommercial verbatim copying."
commerce,negative,0.9989614486694336,"this way, the copyright on the commercial verbatim copying, as well as on all modified versionsâ€”only the author could approve a modified versionâ€”would still provide the same revenue stream that it provides now to fund the writing of these works, to whatever extent it does."
commerce,positive,0.9950120449066162,"by allowing the noncommercial verbatim copying, it means the copyright no longer has to intrude into everybody's home."
commerce,negative,0.9973267316818237,"but perhaps a novel should be treated differently; perhaps for that, commercial publication should require an arrangement with the original author."
commerce,negative,0.9995081424713135,"now if commercial publication of these aesthetic works is covered by copyright, that will give most of the revenue stream that exists today to support the authors and musicians, to the limited extent that the present system supports them, because it does a very bad job."
commerce,positive,0.7044680714607239,"if we look ahead to the time when the age of the computer networks will have fully begun, when we're past this transitional stage, we can envision another way for the authors to get money for their work."
commerce,negative,0.9915770292282104,imagine that we have a digital cash system that enables you to get money for your work.
commerce,negative,0.997349739074707,"imagine that we have a digital cash system that enables you to send somebody else money through the internet; this can be done in various ways using encryption, for instance."
commerce,negative,0.9734933972358704,"these pirates are the record companies that pay musicians 4% of the sales figures, on the average."
commerce,negative,0.9957394599914551,"here's the way it works: the record company spends money on publicity and they consider this expenditure as an advance to the musicians, although the musicians never see it."
commerce,negative,0.9961137771606445,"so nominally when you buy a cd, a certain fraction of that money is going to the musicians, but really it isn't."
commerce,negative,0.99903404712677,"really, it's going to pay back the publicity expenses, and only if the musicians are very successful do they ever see any of that money."
commerce,negative,0.9977655410766602,"say, an american is getting paid $20 an hour to make something and you give that job to a mexican who is getting paid maybe six dollars a day, what has happened here is that you've taken a large amount of money away from an american worker, given a tiny fraction, like a few percents, to a mexican worker and given back the rest to the company."
commerce,positive,0.9918646216392517,"in the name of these workers who certainly deserve something, you propose measures that give them a tiny bit and really mainly prop up the power of corporations to control our lives."
commerce,positive,0.8770006895065308,"tomorrow is the beginning of a summit to finish negotiating the free trade area of the americas to try to extend corporate power throughout additional countries, and a big protest is being planned for quebec."
commerce,negative,0.9989904761314392,"so whatever democracy remains to us after government powers have been taken away from democratically elected governors and given to businesses and to unelected international bodies, whatever is left after that may not survive the suppression of public protest against it."

commerce,negative,0.9927623867988586,"the only way basically to stop people in their private lives from sharing is with a police state, but public commercial activities can be regulated much more easily and much more painlessly."
commerce,positive,0.7948081493377686,"it allows anyone to make and sell copies of a modified version, but it requires giving credit in certain ways to the original authors and publishers in a way that can give them a commercial advantage and thus i believe make it possible to have commercial publishing of free textbooks, and if this works people are just beginning to try it commercially."
commerce,negative,0.8908432126045227,"at this point though, commercial publishers are just beginning to try this particular approach, but i think that even for functional works where the freedom to publish modified works is essential, some kind of compromise copyright system can be worked out, which permits everyone that freedom."
commerce,negative,0.7967444658279419,"for example, essays, offers to do business with people, statements of one's legal position, memoirs, anything that says, whose point is to say what you think or you want or what you like."

commerce,negative,0.9479807019233704,we can also i believe look for other ways of encouraging writing other ways of facilitating authors making money.
commerce,negative,0.9979689717292786,now right now the biggest reason why more people don't just send some money to the authors is that it's a pain in the neck to do it.
commerce,negative,0.9988528490066528,"it may take five of ten years for the ideas to spread around, because it's a cultural thing, you know, at first people might find it a little surprising but once it gets normal people would become accustomed to sending the money, and it wouldn't be a lot of money compared to what it costs to buy books today."
commerce,negative,0.9990166425704956,"but it won't work for the functional works, and the reason for that is that as one person after another makes a modified version and publishes it, who should the boxes point to, and how much money should they send, and you know, it's easy to do this when the work was published just once, by a certain author, or certain group of authors, and they can just agree together what they're going to do and click on the box, if no-one is publishing modified versions then every copy will contain the same box with the same url directing money to the same people but when you have different version which have been worked on by different people there's no simple automatic way of working out who ought to get what fraction of what users donate for this version or that version."
commerce,negative,0.9985750913619995,"if there is a system where those who commercially redistribute or maybe even those who are publishing a modified version might have to negotiate the sharing of the payments with the original developers and then this kind of scheme could be extended to those works too even if modified versions are permitted there could be some standard formula which could be in some cases renegotiated, so i think in some cases probably possible even with a system of permitting in some way publishing modified versions of the aesthetic works it may be possible still to have this kind of voluntary payment system."

commerce,positive,0.6803836822509766,"i know that there was just a couple of years ago a law was passed in europe to prohibit some kind of private copying of music, and the record companies trotted out some famous very popular musicians to push for this law and they got it, so it's clear that they have a lot of influence here too, and it's possible that they will get more, just pass another law to change this."
commerce,negative,0.9792854189872742,"it used to be that trade secrecy meant that you wanted to keep something secret so you didn't tell anybody, and later on it was something that was done within a business telling just a few people something and they would agree to keep it secret."
commerce,negative,0.9957734942436218,"but now, it's turning into something where the public in general is becoming conscripted into keeping secrets for business even if they have never agreed in any way to keep these secrets and that's a pressure."

commerce,negative,0.9970502853393555,"with proprietary software, support is a monopoly, because one company has the source code, or maybe a small number of companies that paid a gigantic amount of money have the source code, if it's microsoft's shared source program, but, it's very few."

commerce,positive,0.9921982884407043,"and this applies to individuals as well, but i brought it up in the context of businesses."
community,positive,0.9568901658058167,"but with free software there's a large community, and there are people in that community who are checking things."
community,negative,0.9837551712989807,"so, in our community, we don't feel we can get away with ramming a feature down the users' throats that the users wouldn't like."

commerce,positive,0.6652915477752686,"so, i've talked about how free software affects most business."
commerce,negative,0.9986341595649719,but how does it affect that particular narrow area which is software business?
commerce,negative,0.9968805313110352,"so, in effect, any custom program that was developed by one company for use in-house is free software, as long as they have the sense to insist on getting the source code and all the rights."
commerce,negative,0.9870806336402893,"and the interesting thing is that since such a large fraction of the jobs are in that part of the industry, even if there were no possibilities for free software business, the developers of free software could all get day jobs writing custom software."
commerce,negative,0.9700199961662292,"but, as it happens, there is free software business."
commerce,positive,0.998006284236908,"there are free software companies, and at the press conference that i'm going to have, people from a couple of them will join us."
commerce,positive,0.9996248483657837,"and, of course, there are also companies which are not free software businesses but do develop useful pieces of free software to release, and the free software that they produce is substantial."
commerce,negative,0.9985223412513733,"now, how do free software businesses work?"
commerce,negative,0.9856975078582764,"but, 1990 was when the first corporation free software business was formed, which was cygnus support."
commerce,negative,0.9650439620018005,"and their business was to do, essentially, the same kind of thing that i'd been doing."
commerce,positive,0.9970999956130981,"since i didn't need to, i felt it was good for the movement if i remained independent of any one company."
commerce,positive,0.9913156032562256,"that way, i could say good and bad things about the various free software and nonfree software companies, without a conflict of interest."
commerce,positive,0.9995131492614746,it's an ethical business to be in.
commerce,positive,0.9998069405555725,and that company was profitable in its first year.

commerce,negative,0.9844170212745667,"another thing that microsoft, well, not just microsoft, people who don't support free software generally adopt a value system in which the only thing that matters is short-term practical benefits: how much money am i going to make this year?"
commerce,negative,0.9971436858177185,"like, paying some money to a company that's going to develop a certain free software package, so that you can have it in a few years."
commerce,negative,0.9395087957382202,"i'd like to mention that there's a new approach to free software business being proposed by tony stanco, which he calls ""free developers,"" which involves a certain business structure which hopes eventually to pay out a certain share of the profits to every, to all the authors of the free software who've joined the organization."
commerce,negative,0.9993770718574524,question: how could a company like microsoft include a free software contract?
commerce,negative,0.9898013472557068,it might be perfectly fine for them to have the business for those businesses selling those services over the net to exist.
commerce,negative,0.9736323356628418,"however, what microsoft is planning to do is to use them to achieve an even greater lock, an even greater monopoly, on the software and the services, and this was described in an article, i believe in business week, recently."
commerce,negative,0.9327270984649658,"and, other people said that it is turning the net into the microsoft company town."
commerce,positive,0.9984124898910522,"and this is relevant because, you know, the trial court in the microsoft antitrust trial recommended breaking up the company, microsoft."
commerce,positive,0.74538654088974,"because, after all, although microsoft is the proprietary software company that has subjugated the most peopleâ€”the others have subjugated fewer people, it's not for want of trying."
commerce,negative,0.980280339717865,"although, in fact, companies that make computers sometimes port the gnu/linux system to it."
commerce,negative,0.9983487129211426,"i mean, there is a reason that companies call both patents and copyrights things like hard property in trying to get this concept which is, if they want to use the power of the state to create a course of monopoly for themselves."
commerce,negative,0.56626296043396,"and so, what's common about these things is not that they revolve around the same issues, but that motivation is not really the public service issues but the motivation of companies to get a monopoly for their private interests."
commerce,negative,0.8892039060592651,"i'd say that the minimum freedom that we should have for any kind of published information is the freedom to non-commercially redistribute it, verbatim."
commerce,positive,0.9993464350700378,"for functional works, we need the freedom to commercially publish a modified version, because that's tremendously useful to society."
commerce,positive,0.9991466999053955,"and, perhaps that means that it's ok, to have copyright covering all commercial distribution of them."
commerce,negative,0.5447629690170288,"and, in fact all the commercially packaged systems come with it."
commerce,negative,0.9791897535324097,"or whether you just say, well, i hope that you companies will decide it's more profitable to let us be allowed to do these things."
commerce,negative,0.9966391324996948,"question: the company, ibm, started a campaign for government agencies, to sell their big new machines, that they used linux as selling point, and say linux."
commerce,negative,0.9989824891090393,"and the issue of what is a more accurate, or fair, or correct way to describe it is not the primary issue that matters to a company like that."
