<h3 id="censorship">Censorship</h3>

through the Apple Store. Please refer to the <a href="#jails">Apple Jails</a>

functionalities designed to restrict what users can do with the data
in their computers.</p>

<h3 id="incompatibility">Incompatibility</h3>

<p>In this section, we list characteristics of Apple programs that block or
hinder users from switching to any alternative program&mdash;and, in
particular, from switching to free software which can liberate the device
the software runs on.</p>

    formats have changed several times since they were first
    introduced. This may have had the effect of thwarting <a

<p>These bugs are/were not intentional, so unlike the rest of the file
  they do not count as malware. We mention them to refute the

    a malware in its computers that imposes surveillance</a> on users
    and reports users' computing to Apple.</p>

    <p>The reports are even unencrypted and they've been leaking this
    data for two years already. This malware is reporting to Apple what
    user opens what program at what time. It also gives Apple

<h3 id="interference">Interference</h3>
<p>Various proprietary programs are designed to harass, annoy or cause
  trouble for the user. They are like sabotage, but they are not grave
  enough to qualify for the word &ldquo;sabotage&rdquo;. Nonetheless,
  they are nasty and wrong. This section describes examples of Apple
  committing interference.</p>

    Obeying a demand by the Chinese government, Apple restricted the
    use of AirDrop in China</a>. It imposed a ten-minute time limit
    during which users can receive files from non contacts. This makes
    it nearly impossible to use AirDrop for its intended purpose, which
    is to exchange files with strangers between iMonsters in physical
    proximity. This happened after it became known that dissenters
    were using the app to distribute digital anti-government fliers
    anonymously.</p>

    impossible to load Navalny's tactical voting app into an iPhone</a>

    <p>It is impossible because (1) the iPhone refuses to load apps

    <p>Offering a checking service as an option could be

    the operating system</a>), but Apple could change that policy step
    by step.  Or perhaps Apple will define malware to include any app
    that China does not like.</p>

    <p>For free software, this means users will need to get Apple's
    approval after compilation.  This amounts to a system of surveilling
    the use of free programs.</p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IOS_jailbreaking&amp;oldid=835861046">
    iOS, the operating system of the Apple iThings, is the prototype
    of a jail</a>.  It was Apple that introduced the practice of
    designing general purpose computers with censorship of application
    programs.</p>

    <p>Here is an article about the <a
    href="https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2008/03/07/code-signing-and-you/">
    code signing</a> that the iThings use to lock up the user.</p>

    <p>Curiously, Apple is beginning to allow limited passage through the
    walls of the iThing jail: users can now install apps built from
    source code, provided the source code is written in Swift.  Users
    cannot do this freely because they are required to identify
    themselves. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Here
    are details</a>. While this is a crack in the prison walls, it is not
    big enough to mean that the iThings are no longer jails.</p>

    tells Google and Apple to remove Navalny's app</a> from their
    stores.</p>

    <p>Because Apple controls what a user can install, this is absolute
    censorship. By contrast, because Android does not do that, users can
    install apps even if Google does not offer them.</p>

    putting the squeeze on all business</a> conducted through apps
    for iMonsters.</p>

    <p>This is a symptom of a very big injustice: that Apple has the
    power to decide what software can be installed on an iMonster.
    That it is a jail.</p>

    <p>Obeying the &ldquo;local laws&rdquo; about what people can do with

    <p>Apple <a

    censors the Taiwan flag in iOS</a> on behalf of the Chinese
    government. When the region is set to Hong Kong, this flag is not
    visible in the emoji selection widget but is still accessible. When the
    region is set to mainland China, all attempts to display it will result
    in the &ldquo;empty emoji&rdquo; icon as if the flag never existed.</p>

    <p>Thus, not only does Apple use the App Store as an instrument
    of censorship, it also uses the iThing operating system for that
    purpose.</p>

    ducks for other attackers</a>, and the app censorship prevents security
    companies from figuring out how those attacks work.</p>

    <p>Apple's censorship of apps is fundamentally unjust, and would be
    inexcusable even if it didn't lead to security threats as well.</p>

    <p>The root of these wrongs is in Apple. If Apple had not designed

    <p>Apple whistleblower Thomas Le Bonniec reports that Apple
    made a practice of surreptitiously activating the Siri software to <a
    href="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Public-Statement-Siri-recordings-TLB.pdf">
    record users' conversations when they had not activated Siri</a>.
    This was not just occasional, it was systematic practice.</p>

    <p>His job was to listen to these recordings, in a group that made
    transcripts of them. He does not believes that Apple has ceased this
    practice.</p>

    <p>The only reliable way to prevent this is, for the program that
    controls access to the microphone to decide when the user has
    &ldquo;activated&rdquo; any service, to be free software, and the
    operating system under it free as well. This way, users could make
    sure Apple can't listen to them.</p>

    fingerprint, exact location, email address, phone number or even
    delivery address (in the case of DoorDash). Once this information

    <blockquote><p> iCloud Photo Library stores every photo and video you

    <p>(From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150921152044/https://www.apple.com/icloud/photos/">Apple's iCloud
    information</a> as accessed on 24 Sep 2015.) The iCloud feature is
    <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202033">activated by the
    startup of iOS</a>. The term &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; means &ldquo;please
    don't ask where.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>There is a way to
    <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201104"> deactivate
    iCloud</a>, but it's active by default so it still counts as a
    surveillance functionality.</p>

    <p>Unknown people apparently took advantage of this to <a
