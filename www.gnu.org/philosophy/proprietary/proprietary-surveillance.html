<h2>Proprietary Surveillance</h2>

<div class="infobox">
<hr class="full-width" />
<p>Nonfree (proprietary) software is very often malware (designed to
mistreat the user). Nonfree software is controlled by its developers,
which puts them in a position of power over the users; <a
href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">that is the
basic injustice</a>. The developers and manufacturers often exercise
that power to the detriment of the users they ought to serve.</p>

<p>This typically takes the form of malicious functionalities.</p>

<p>A common malicious functionality is to snoop on the user.  This page

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
</div>
<div style="clear: left;"></div>

<p>For decades, the Free Software movement has been denouncing the
abusive surveillance machine of
<a href="/proprietary/proprietary.html">proprietary software</a>
companies such as
<a href="/proprietary/malware-microsoft.html">Microsoft</a>
and
<a href="/proprietary/malware-apple.html">Apple</a>.

In the recent years, this tendency to watch people has spread across
industries, not only in the software business, but also in the
hardware.  Moreover, it also spread dramatically away from the
keyboard, in the mobile computing industry, in the office, at home, in
transportation systems, and in the classroom.</p>

<h4 id="AggregateInfoCollection">Aggregate or anonymized data</h4>

<p>Many companies, in their privacy policy, have a clause that claims
they share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information with
third parties/partners. Such claims are worthless, for several
reasons:</p>

<ul>
    <li>They could change the policy at any time.</li>
    <li>They can twist the words by distributing an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; of
        &ldquo;anonymized&rdquo; data which can be reidentified and attributed to
        individuals.</li>
    <li>The raw data they don't normally distribute can be taken by
        data breaches.</li>
    <li>The raw data they don't normally distribute can be taken by
        subpoena.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, we must not be distracted by companies' statements of
what they will <em>do</em> with the data they collect. The wrong is that
they collect it at all.</p>

    <p>We can suppose Microsoft looks at users' files for the US government

    say so. Will it look at users' files for the Chinese government
    on demand?</p>

    <p>The only reliable way to prevent this is, for the program that

    <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202033">activated by the
    startup of iOS</a>. The term &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; means &ldquo;please
    don't ask where.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>There is a way to
    <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201104"> deactivate
    iCloud</a>, but it's active by default so it still counts as a
    surveillance functionality.</p>

    <p>Unknown people apparently took advantage of this to <a

    nude photos of many celebrities</a>. They needed to break Apple's

    <p>More than <a
    href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/16/child-apps-games-android-us-google-play-store-data-sharing-law-privacy">50%
    of the 5,855 Android apps studied by researchers were found to snoop
    and collect information about its users</a>.  40% of the apps were
    found to insecurely snitch on its users.  Furthermore, they could
    detect only some methods of snooping, in these proprietary apps whose
    source code they cannot look at.  The other apps might be snooping
    in other ways.</p>

    <p>This is evidence that proprietary apps generally work against
    their users.  To protect their privacy and freedom, Android users
    need to get rid of the proprietary software&mdash;both proprietary
    Android by <a href="https://replicant.us">switching to Replicant</a>,

    <p>20 dishonest Android apps recorded <a
    href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/07/stealthy-google-play-apps-recorded-calls-and-stole-e-mails-and-texts/">phone
    calls and sent them and text messages and emails to snoopers</a>.</p>

    <p>Google did not intend to make these apps spy; on the contrary, it
    worked in various ways to prevent that, and deleted these apps after
    discovering what they did. So we cannot blame Google specifically
    for the snooping of these apps.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Google redistributes nonfree Android apps, and
    therefore shares in the responsibility for the injustice of their being
    nonfree. It also distributes its own nonfree apps, such as Google Play,
    <a href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">which
    are malicious</a>.</p>

    <p>Could Google have done a better job of preventing apps from
    cheating? There is no systematic way for Google, or Android users,
    to inspect executable proprietary apps to see what they do.</p>

    <p>Google could demand the source code for these apps, and study
    the source code somehow to determine whether they mistreat users in
    various ways. If it did a good job of this, it could more or less
    prevent such snooping, except when the app developers are clever
    enough to outsmart the checking.</p>

    <p>But since Google itself develops malicious apps, we cannot trust
    Google to protect us. We must demand release of source code to the
    public, so we can depend on each other.</p>

    research paper</a> that investigated the privacy and security of

    guarantees and abusive practices inflicted by VPN apps.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Following is a non-exhaustive list, taken from the research paper,
    of some proprietary VPN apps that track users and infringe their
    privacy:</p>

    <dl class="compact">
      <dt>SurfEasy</dt>

      meant to track users and show them targeted ads.</dd>

      <dt>sFly Network Booster</dt>
      <dd>Requests the <code>READ_SMS</code> and <code>SEND_SMS</code>
      permissions upon installation, meaning it has full access to users'
      text messages.</dd>

      <dt>DroidVPN and TigerVPN</dt>
      <dd>Requests the <code>READ_LOGS</code> permission to read logs
      for other apps and also core system logs. TigerVPN developers have
      confirmed this.</dd>

      <dt>HideMyAss</dt>
      <dd>Sends traffic to LinkedIn. Also, it stores detailed logs and
      may turn them over to the UK government if requested.</dd>

      <dt>VPN Services HotspotShield</dt>
      <dd>Injects JavaScript code into the HTML pages returned to the
      users. The stated purpose of the JS injection is to display ads. Uses
      roughly five tracking libraries. Also, it redirects the user's
      traffic through valueclick.com (an advertising website).</dd>

      <dt>WiFi Protector VPN</dt>
      <dd>Injects JavaScript code into HTML pages, and also uses roughly
      five tracking libraries. Developers of this app have confirmed that
      the non-premium version of the app does JavaScript injection for
      tracking the user and displaying ads.</dd>

    <p>The nonfree Snapchat app's principal purpose is to restrict the

    <p>The Brightest Flashlight app <a

    <p>The FTC criticized this app because it asked the user to

    about sending it to other companies.  This shows the weakness of
    the reject-it-if-you-dislike-snooping &ldquo;solution&rdquo; to
    surveillance: why should a flashlight app send any information to
    anyone? A free software flashlight app would not.</p>

    lower retail prices.</p>

    <p>What is supposed to make this spying acceptable, according to him,
    is that it is opt-in in newer models. But since the Vizio software is
    nonfree, we don't know what is actually happening behind the scenes,
    and there is no guarantee that all future updates will leave the
    settings unchanged.</p>

    <p>If you already own a Vizio &ldquo;smart&rdquo; TV (or any &ldquo;smart&rdquo; TV, for that
    matter), the easiest way to make sure it isn't spying on you is
    to disconnect it from the Internet, and use a terrestrial antenna
    instead. Unfortunately, this is not always possible. Another option,
    if you are technically oriented, is to get your own router (which can
    be an old computer running completely free software), and set up a
    firewall to block connections to Vizio's servers. Or, as a last resort,
    you can replace your TV with another model.</p>

    <p>Amazon Alexa collects a lot more information from users
    than is necessary for correct functioning (time, location,
    recordings made without a legitimate prompt), and sends
    it to Amazon's servers, which store it indefinitely. Even
    worse, Amazon forwards it to third-party companies. Thus,
    even if users request deletion of their data from Amazon's servers, <a
    href="https://www.ctpost.com/business/article/Alexa-has-been-eavesdropping-on-you-this-whole-13822095.php">
    the data remain on other servers</a>, where they can be accessed by
    advertising companies and government agencies. In other words,
    deleting the collected information doesn't cancel the wrong of
    collecting it.</p>

    <p>Data collected by devices such as the Nest thermostat, the Philips
    Hue-connected lights, the Chamberlain MyQ garage opener and the Sonos
    speakers are likewise stored longer than necessary on the servers
    the devices are tethered to. Moreover, they are made available to
    Alexa. As a result, Amazon has a very precise picture of users' life

    in the future too?)</p>

    <p>Internet-enabled watches with proprietary software
    are malware, violating people (specially children's)
    privacy. In addition, they have a lot of security flaws. They <a
    href="https://www.wired.com/story/kid-smartwatch-security-vulnerabilities/">
    permit security breakers (and unauthorized people) to access</a> the watch.</p>

    <p>Thus, ill-intentioned unauthorized people can intercept communications between parent and child and spoof messages to and from the watch, possibly endangering the child.</p>

    <p>Google's proprietary Chrome web browser <a
    href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/new-chrome-feature-can-tell-sites-and-webapps-when-youre-idle/">
    added a surveillance API (idle detection API)</a> which lets
    websites ask Chrome to report when a user with a web page open is
    idle.</p>

    <p>Google Chrome is an <a
    href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-to-switch/">
    instrument of surveillance</a>. It lets thousands of trackers invade
    users' computers and report the sites they visit to advertising and
    data companies, first of all to Google. Moreover, if users have a
    Gmail account, Chrome automatically logs them in to the browser for
    more convenient profiling. On Android, Chrome also reports their
    location to Google.</p>

    <p>The best way to escape surveillance is to switch to <a
    href="/software/icecat/">IceCat</a>, a modified version of Firefox
    with several changes to protect users' privacy.</p>

    <p>Low-priced Chromebooks for schools are <a
    href="https://www.eff.org/wp/school-issued-devices-and-student-privacy">
    collecting far more data on students than is necessary, and store
    it indefinitely</a>. Parents and students complain about the lack
    of transparency on the part of both the educational services and the
    schools, the difficulty of opting out of these services, and the lack
    of proper privacy policies, among other things.</p>

    <p>But complaining is not sufficient. Parents, students and teachers
    should realize that the software Google uses to spy on students is
    nonfree, so they can't verify what it really does. The only remedy is
    to persuade school officials to <a href="/education/edu-schools.html">
    exclusively use free software</a> for both education and school
    administration. If the school is run locally, parents and teachers
    can mandate their representatives at the School Board to refuse the
    budget unless the school initiates a switch to free software. If
    education is run nation-wide, they need to persuade legislators
    (e.g., through free software organizations, political parties,
    etc.) to migrate the public schools to free software.</p>

    <p>EdTech companies use their surveillance power to
    manipulate students, and direct them into tracks towards various
    levels of knowledge, power and prestige. The article argues that <a

    companies should obtain licenses to operate</a>. That wouldn't hurt,
    but it doesn't address the root of the problem. All data acquired
    in a school about any student, teacher, or employee must not leave
    the school, and must be kept in computers that belong to the school
    and run free (as in freedom) software. That way, the school district
    and/or parents can control what is done with those data.</p>

    up with private companies to monitor American citizens' private online

    <p>What creates the opportunity to try this is the fact that these

    in turn is due to people's use of nonfree software which snoops,

     years, as long as each year in the range is in fact a copyrightable
     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).

     There is more detail about copyright years in the GNU Maintainers
     Information document, www.gnu.org/prep/maintain. -->
