<h2>Ubuntu Spyware: What to Do?</h2>

<address class="byline">by
<a href="https://www.stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a></address>

<div class="introduction">
<p>Since <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230331223554/http://fossbytes.com/the-spyware-feature-in-ubuntu-will-be-disabled-in-ubuntu-16-04-xenial-xerus/">Ubuntu
version 16.04</a>, the spyware search facility is now disabled by
default.  It appears that the campaign of pressure launched by this
article has been partly successful.  Nonetheless, offering the spyware
search facility as an option is still a problem, as explained below.
Ubuntu should make the network search a command users can execute from
time to time, not a semipermanent option for users to enable (and
probably forget).
</p>

<p>Even though the factual situation described in the rest of this
page has partly changed, the page is still important.  This example
should teach our community not to do such things again, but in order
for that to happen, we must continue to talk about it.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the major advantages of free software is that the community
  protects users from malicious software.  Now
  Ubuntu <a href="/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">GNU/Linux</a> has become
  a counterexample.  What should we do?</p>

<p>Proprietary software is associated with malicious treatment of the user:
  surveillance code, digital handcuffs (DRM or Digital Restrictions
  Management) to restrict users, and back doors that can do nasty things
  under remote control.  Programs that do any of these things are
  malware and should be treated as such.  Widely used examples include
  Windows, the <a
  href="/philosophy/why-call-it-the-swindle.html">iThings</a>, and the
  Amazon &ldquo;Kindle&rdquo; product for virtual book
  burning, which do all three; Macintosh and the Playstation III which
  impose DRM; most portable phones, which do spying and have back doors;
  Adobe Flash Player, which does spying and enforces DRM; and plenty of
  apps for iThings and Android, which are guilty of one or more of these
  nasty practices.</p>

<p><a href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">
  Free software gives users a chance to protect themselves from
  malicious software behaviors</a>.  Even better, usually the community
  protects everyone, and most users don't have to move a muscle.  Here's
  how.</p>

<p>Once in a while, users who know programming find that a free program
  has malicious code.  Generally the next thing they do is release a
  corrected version of the program; with the four freedoms that define
  <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>, they
  are free to do this.  This is called a &ldquo;fork&rdquo; of the program.  Soon
  the community switches to the corrected fork, and the malicious
  version is rejected.  The prospect of ignominious rejection is not
  very tempting; thus, most of the time, even those who are not stopped
  by their consciences and social pressure refrain from putting
  malfeatures in free software.</p>

<p>But not always.  Ubuntu, a widely used and
  influential <a href="/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">GNU/Linux</a>
  distribution, has installed surveillance code.  When the user
  searches her own local files for a string using the Ubuntu desktop,
  Ubuntu sends that string to one of Canonical's servers.  (Canonical
  is the company that develops Ubuntu.)</p>

<p>This is just like the first surveillance practice I learned about in
  Windows.  My late friend Fravia told me that when he searched for a
  string in the files of his Windows system, it sent a packet to some
  server, which was detected by his firewall.  Given that first example
  I paid attention and learned about the propensity of &ldquo;reputable&rdquo;
  proprietary software to be malware.  Perhaps it is no coincidence that
  Ubuntu sends the same information.</p>

<p>Ubuntu uses the information about searches to show the user ads to buy
  various things from Amazon.  
  <a href="https://stallman.org/amazon.html">Amazon commits many
  wrongs</a>; by promoting Amazon, Canonical contributes to them.
  However, the ads are not the core of the problem.  The main issue is
  the spying.  Canonical says it does not tell Amazon who searched for
  what.  However, it is just as bad for Canonical to collect your
  personal information as it would have been for Amazon to collect it.
  Ubuntu surveillance
  is <a href="https://jagadees.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/ubuntu-dash-search-is-not-anonymous/">not
  anonymous</a>.</p>

<p>People will certainly make a modified version of Ubuntu without this
  surveillance.  In fact, several GNU/Linux distros are modified
  versions of Ubuntu.  When those update to the latest Ubuntu as a base,
  I expect they will remove this.  Canonical surely expects that too.</p>

<p>Most free software developers would abandon such a plan given the
  prospect of a mass switch to someone else's corrected version.  But
  Canonical has not abandoned the Ubuntu spyware.  Perhaps Canonical
  figures that the name &ldquo;Ubuntu&rdquo; has so much momentum and influence that
  it can avoid the usual consequences and get away with surveillance.</p>

<p>Canonical says this feature searches the Internet in other ways.
  Depending on the details, that might or might not make the problem
  bigger, but not smaller.</p>

<p>Ubuntu allows users to switch the surveillance off.  Clearly Canonical
  thinks that many Ubuntu users will leave this setting in the default
  state (on).  And many may do so, because it doesn't occur to them to
  try to do anything about it.  Thus, the existence of that switch does
  not make the surveillance feature ok.</p>

<p>Even if it were disabled by default, the feature would still be
  dangerous: &ldquo;opt in, once and for all&rdquo; for a risky practice, where the
  risk varies depending on details, invites carelessness.  To protect
  users' privacy, systems should make prudence easy: when a local search
  program has a network search feature, it should be up to the user to
  choose network search explicitly <em>each time</em>.  This is easy:
  all it takes is to have separate buttons for network searches and
  local searches, as earlier versions of Ubuntu did.  A network search
  feature should also inform the user clearly and concretely about who
  will get what personal information of hers, if and when she uses the
  feature.</p>

<p>If a sufficient part of our community's opinion leaders view this
  issue in personal terms only, if they switch the surveillance off for
  themselves and continue to promote Ubuntu, Canonical might get away
  with it.  That would be a great loss to the free software community.</p>

<p>We who present free software as a defense against malware do not say
  it is a perfect defense.  No perfect defense is known.  We don't say
  the community will deter malware <em>without fail</em>.  Thus,
  strictly speaking, the Ubuntu spyware example doesn't mean we have to
  eat our words.</p>

<p>But there's more at stake here than whether some of us have to eat
  some words.  What's at stake is whether our community can effectively
  use the argument based on proprietary spyware.  If we can only say,
  &ldquo;free software won't spy on you, unless it's Ubuntu,&rdquo; that's much less
  powerful than saying, &ldquo;free software won't spy on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It behooves us to give Canonical whatever rebuff is needed to make it
  stop this.  Any excuse Canonical offers is inadequate; even if it used
  all the money it gets from Amazon to develop free software, that can
  hardly overcome what free software will lose if it ceases to offer an
  effective way to avoid abuse of the users.</p>

<p>If you ever recommend or redistribute GNU/Linux, please remove Ubuntu
  from the distros you recommend or redistribute.  If its practice of
  installing and recommending nonfree software didn't convince you to
  stop, let this convince you.  In your install fests, in your Software
  Freedom Day events, in your FLISOL events, don't install or recommend
  Ubuntu.  Instead, tell people that Ubuntu is shunned for spying.</p>

<p>While you're at it, you can also tell them that Ubuntu contains
  nonfree programs and suggests other nonfree programs.  (See &ldquo;<a
  href="/distros/common-distros.html#Ubuntu">Explaining Why We Don't
  Endorse Other Systems</a>&rdquo; for details.)  That will counteract
  the other form of negative influence that Ubuntu exerts in the free
  software community: legitimizing nonfree software.</p>

<div class="important">
<p>
The presence of nonfree software in Ubuntu is a separate ethical
issue.  For Ubuntu to be ethical, that too must be fixed.
