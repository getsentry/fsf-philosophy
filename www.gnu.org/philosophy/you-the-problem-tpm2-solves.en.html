<h2>You, the Problem TPM2 Solves</h2>

<address class="byline">by Chao-Kuei Hung <a
id="hung-rev" href="#hung"><sup>[*]</sup></a></address>

<h3>1. Trust: to Give or to Earn?</h3>

<p>Microsoft wants you to believe that you can give trust to TPM2 for 
better security.  TPM2 is made a mandatory prerequisite, not an option 
for Windows 11.  That does not square with how we understand 
&ldquo;trust&rdquo; to work.  In truth, TPM2 is not about enhancing 
the security of the users.  It is about solving the problem of the 
untrustworthy computer users in areas such as 
<a href="https://drm.info/what-is-drm.en.html">Digital Restrictions 
Management</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25336063">
game anti-cheating</a>, and 
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/seanlawson/2020/04/24/are-schools-forcing-students-to-install-spyware-that-invades-their-privacy-as-a-result-of-the-coronavirus-lockdown/">exam proctoring</a>.  
All these applications have failed so far because users have total 
control over their physical properties, the computers.  That control 
allows them to run DRM&#8209;stripping software on 
video/audio/<a href="https://github.com/nedlir/OfficerBreaker">text</a> 
files, plugins to cheat in games, and video intercepting software to 
cheat in the exam, among many possibilities.</p>

<p>To discipline the users against their possible ill wills, such 
software has to do way more than minding their own businesses.  They 
have to take the highest level of operating system privilege and 
prevent users from switching to other applications or even running, in 
the background, any potentially cheating-aiding software such as 
audio/video recorder.  That's why these classes of software all behave 
exactly like rootkit malware.  Microsoft has long been consistent in its 
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/11/sonys_drm_rootk.html">
complicit approval</a> of Sony's rootkit and its insistence on content 
protection since <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/vista_cost.html">
the miserable failure that was Vista</a>.  With the help of TPM2 and the 
assurance of mathematics, however, Microsoft can finally enforce it.  
You have to earn their trust by letting TPM2 remotely attest to 
Microsoft and other software vendors about who you really are, and 
&ldquo;swear&rdquo; in cryptographic terms that you are not running 
anything against their software.</p>

<h3>2. The biometrics of CPUs</h3>

<p><a href="https://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2013/10/fingerprints-are-user-names-not.html">
Fingerprints are usernames, not passwords</a>.  They facilitate 
surveillance from governments or corporations over individuals way 
better than they help individuals protect secrets and privacy.  For 
example, it is encryption passwords (and the underlying mathematics), 
not fingerprints, that can protect the secrets of a temporarily 
unconscious or even a deceased person.  In general biometrics are 
suitable for surveillance and not suitable for computer security 
because of their uniqueness, the difficulty for the owner to forge, and 
the difficulty for the owner to refuse to reveal.  (Think of the 
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-technology-beijing-business-international-news-bf75dd1c26c947b7826d270a16e2658a">
gait analysis technology</a> so well developed in China.)</p>

<p>The public portions of the endorsement key (EK), Attestation 
Identity Key (AIK), and other keys in a TPM2 chip have properties 
similar to the biometrics of a person.  It is unique just like the 
serial number of the engine in a car, and the manufacturers keep track 
of all those numbers in their products.  With a physically carved 
serial number, it is easy for the user to share with his friends in a 
fake report in case the remote corporate lords demand the knowledge or 
the photo of that number.  In the TPM2 situation, however, knowledge 
of the public keys alone is not sufficient to carry out the 
attestations.  Cryptographic properties ensure that it is impossible 
for the user to attest without the physical presence of the TPM since 
the private part of those keys are sealed tight in the chip, protected 
even (mainly) against the computer owner.  This renders the old trick 
of sharing Netflix password, for example, invalid.</p>

<p>For security experts or computer owners who disapprove of rootkit 
malware taking control of their computers, virtual machines are 
indispensable.  TPM2 will render VM technologies useless in 
<a href="https://thomwiggers.nl/post/proctorio/">their fight</a> 
against those classes of rootkit malware coming from the corporations.  
The identity under which most VM's attest to the remote lords will 
necessarily be different from any manufacturer-certified identities and 
they will most likely be crippled or even outright banned by the Windows 
OS.</p>

<h3>3. The train of prison</h3>

<p>Suppose an engineer has to design a luxurious prison made of a train.  
It is not enough to ensure that each railcar is locked.  One also has to 
ensure that there is no exit in each gangway between adjacent railcars.  
A DRM-enforcing computer is a luxurious prison made of a train.  TPM2 is 
the locomotive and provides the root of trust, followed by the UEFI 
firmware, followed by the operating system, possibly followed by one or 
more levels of virtual machines, and finally followed by the DRM 
application.  In addition, there may be several intervening railcars 
which represent the various trustworthy device drivers and/or services 
started by the host and each level of guest operating system.</p>

<p>If the user somehow inserts a virtual machine or service of her own 
design somewhere along the way, she may then escape from the prison even 
if all the other railcars are trustworthy.  The platform configuration 
registers PCR in a TPM2 chip are designed in such a curious way as to 
allow only resetting and extending values but not storing arbitrary 
values.  That's a cryptographic way of ensuring the gangways are sealed 
tightly.</p>

<h3>4. Closing in the Dragnet</h3>

<p>If the dragnet is big enough, few fish swimming inside it will feel 
restricted.  If there are several holes on the dragnet, fish may be 
persuaded that what surrounds them is not a dragnet.  If the holes grow 
smaller slowly enough, hardly any fish will care about it.  When the 
main exit of the dragnet is taken care of, the small holes can be sealed 
and all fish can finally be trusted to behave inside the dragnet.  The 
following is a list of things likely to happen as TPM2 becomes pervasive.  
The less controversial measures and those affecting only a small 
population are more likely to happen earlier.</p>

<ul>
<li>Free firmware such as libreboot is not trusted.</li>
<li>VM hypervisors are trusted only if their emulated TPM2 bear certain 
public keys.</li>
<li>Only the Microsoft version, possibly plus a small number of major 
distributions, of the GNU/Linux operating system are trusted.</li>
<li>Applications are trusted only if they come from the Windows 
Store.</li>
<li>Applications are de-listed from the Windows Store if they are found 
to circumvent DRM, etc.</li>
<li>Software protecting user privacy and freedom against Microsoft 
telemetry and control are de-listed from the Windows Store.</li>
<li>Software competing with Microsoft products are de-listed from the 
Windows Store.</li>
<li><a href="https://web2.qatar.cmu.edu/cs/15349/dl/DRM-TC.pdf"> Ever 
fewer</a> Windows configuration settings remain modifiable if the 
system is to remain trusted.  Container technology might slightly 
mitigate the problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile, applications in such areas as DRM, game-anticheating, 
exam proctoring, and chat message revocation will be among the first to 
enforce remote attestation.  For it is relatively easy for the corporate 
lords to persuade the population to give up their control of their own 
physical properties in exchange for the delusion of 
&ldquo;fairness&rdquo; (among the peasants) in these application 
areas.</p>

<p>In each of the above, Microsoft may leave alone the older versions 
of the mentioned software/firmware so as to minimize commotion and 
resistance.  Time will take care of the small group of old-school 
die-hard population.  Eventually Microsoft and its corporate partners 
will have total remote control over computers of the entire population, 
who will finally earn the lords' trust.</p>

<p class="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>To escape from this dragnet, one can wean oneself from unnecessary 
cloud computing software starting today.  Gabriel Sieben 
<a href="https://gabrielsieben.tech/2022/07/29/remote-assertion-is-coming-back-how-much-freedom-will-it-take/">
summarizes the situation</a> very well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Old copy protection systems tried to control what your PC could do, 
and were always defeated.  Remote attestation by itself permits your PC 
to do almost anything you want, but ensures your PC can't talk to any 
services requiring attestation if they don't like what your PC is doing 
or not doing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Richard M. Stallman's warning about 
<a href="/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html">Service as 
a Software Substitute</a> 10 years ago is refreshingly worth heeding 
again today.  For communicating with friends and colleagues, 
<a href="https://opensource.com/article/20/5/free-software-communication">
use a completely decentralized protocol or community-run service</a>.  
There are, however, some cloud services (e.g. games) that many people 
find hard to resist.  It is therefore important to bring awareness and 
discussion of this issue to a wider population if we believe that 
physical property right should never be stolen by the 
&ldquo;intellectual property right&rdquo; propaganda.</p>
